# masters-thesis-experiments
The code and experimental results for my master's thesis on privacy-aware fairness estimation of rules (pafer). 

The code was developed in Python 3.11, a ```requirements.txt``` file is available.

Notebooks are named after the ```researchquestion-dataset.ipynb``` scheme. ```plots.ipynb``` contains all the visualisations but requires the results to be ran.
